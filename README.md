Signing a Transaction:
When you sign a transaction in the blockchain context, it involves adding a cryptographic signature to the transaction data. This signature is generated using the private key of the sender's account. The main purpose of signing a transaction is to prove that the transaction is authorized by the account owner and to ensure the integrity of the data. The signature is a unique mathematical representation of the transaction and cannot be forged or tampered with.
Once a transaction is signed, it can be broadcasted to the network and included in a block for processing. When a miner or validator receives the signed transaction, they can verify the signature using the public key associated with the sender's account. If the signature is valid, the transaction is considered authentic, and it can be executed on the blockchain.

Encrypting a Transaction:
Encryption, on the other hand, involves converting the plain data of a transaction into a scrambled or unreadable format using an encryption algorithm. The main purpose of encryption is to protect sensitive information during transmission or storage. Encryption is commonly used when communicating over the internet or storing data on a server to prevent unauthorized access.
In the context of blockchain transactions, encryption is not commonly applied to the transaction data itself because blockchain networks are designed to be transparent and public. Instead, encryption might be used for other purposes, such as securing communication channels between nodes, encrypting private keys to protect them, or encrypting data in off-chain solutions.

Hashing a Transaction:
When a transaction is created, it contains various pieces of information, such as the sender's address, recipient's address, value to be transferred, and other relevant data. To ensure data integrity and efficiency, the transaction is hashed. Hashing is a one-way process where the transaction data is passed through a cryptographic hash function, resulting in a fixed-length string of characters, known as the transaction hash. This hash uniquely represents the entire content of the transaction.
The transaction hash serves as an identifier for the transaction. It is used in various ways, such as locating the transaction on the blockchain, verifying the integrity of the transaction data, and linking the transaction to other blocks in the blockchain. However, the transaction hash itself does not provide any information about the sender or the recipient, nor does it serve as proof of authorization for the transaction.
